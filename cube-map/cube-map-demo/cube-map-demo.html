<h2>Three Three.js Cubemap Tests</h2>

<noscript>
<p style="color: #A00; font-weight: bold">Sorry, but this page requires JavaScript!</p>
</noscript>

<p>Cube maps used on this page are by <a href="http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures">Emil Persson</a>,
but with resolution reduced to 512-by-512.</p>

<p style="color:#A00; font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%" id="message">Drag on a canvas with left-mouse button to rotate the view.</p>

<div>
    <h3>1. Textured Cube</h3>
    <p>Here, each of the six images from the cube map is loaded separately.<br>
    They are combined into a MeshFaceMaterial and applied to the cube.<br>
    You can see how the pieces of the cube map match up at the edges.</p>
    <canvas width=600 height=600 id="cnvs1" style="background-color:black"></canvas> 
</div>

<hr>

<div>
    <h3>2. Skybox</h3>
    <p>This is simlar to the first example, but the cube is viewed from the<br>
    inside, and the face materials are MeshBasicMaterials instead of<br>
    MeshPhongMaterial.  No lighting is used in this scene.</p>
    <canvas width=600 height=600 id="cnvs2" style="background-color:red"></canvas> 
</div>

<div>
    <h3>3. Skybox with Cubemap Texture</h3>
    <p>Similar to the second example, but it textures the skybox with a single<br>
    cubemap texture instead of with six separate single-face textures.  This uses a<br>
    ShaderMaterial to implement the cubemap texture.  Uses different images for variety.</p>
